            <p>My name is Terrence Wesh, and I’m originally from New York. I’m a senior at Kennesaw State University, 
                and in this class, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of computers and get more hands-on experience. 
                I also want to learn how to tackle complex and broad situations. If you need anything, feel free to contact me 
                via email at <a href="mailto:Twesh@students.Kennesaw.edu">Twesh@students.Kennesaw.edu</a>.
            </p>
            <p>My goal is to specialize in data analytics and technology. I'm passionate about leveraging data to make informed decisions and improve processes.</p>
            <p>During my time at KSU, I have gained valuable skills in programming, problem-solving, and teamwork, which I look forward to applying in my future career.</p>
